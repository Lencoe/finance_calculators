a program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan

.ask them to enter The amount of money that they are depositing.
.The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number
of the interest rate should be entered
.The number of years they plan on investing for
.Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple” or “compound” interest, and store this in a variable
called interest.
.then the program will calculate and print out resluts depending on the user inputs
